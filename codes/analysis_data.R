# Limitations
# The burden for our models are external validity. 
# The data is limited to Ames city, state Iowa from 2006 to 2010, and our prediction model was conducted using test data from Ames, Iowa. 
# Applying these models to other regions, like Washington (or other US state), to commercial markets, or to time periods before 2006 or after 2010. 
# Additionally, the financial crisis of 2008 may had its effect to our models that made them specific to this time period and location. 
# The further work may compare Ames, Iowa to other housing markets or develop a model based off housing data from a larger coverage or at a different country. 
# This difficulty in developing these datasets is consistency in variables across regions. 
# For example, in some countries people may prefer bigger (or smaller) houses, or houses with (or without) fireplaces.
