## Introduction

This is the Assignment 2 for `Data Analysis 2`  and `Coding` course. The aim of this project is  to

analyse the pattern of association between **registered COVID-19 cases** and **registered number of death** due to COVID-19 on 10-31-2020. 
As a source, [covid-19 data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports/10-31-2020.csv) from CSSE^[Center for Systems Science and Engineering] was used. The *population* is all cases reported in CSSE dataset starting from 01-22-2020 until now (the last added report date was 11-28-2020). The *sample* is the dataset that contains confirmed and death cases only from one date: 10-31-2020. The variables that are used are:

* country: string value showing the name of the country
* confirmed: numeric value showing the number of confirmed cases of COVID
* death: numeric value showing the number of death cases from COVID 
* population: numeric value showing the population of the country
* ln_confirmed: log of number of confirmed cases
* ln_death: log of number of death cases

Invalid data (measuring flu cases instead of COVID), unreliable data (showing one value today and showing enormously different value tomorrow) and missing values are the potential data quality issues. 

The dependent (y) variable is *Number of registered death* and explanatory (x) variable is *Number of confirmed case*. Figure 1 below shows the histogram for both variables

Both of the histograms have long right tail because majority of observations have almost same values and only few observations have extreme values. Most of the observations for confirmed cases are between 0 and 2 million, only 2 observations have a value more than 4 million. Most of the death cases are between 0 and 50000 and only 3 observations have a value more than 50000.

my_file <- "../data/clean/covid_pop_09_11_2020_clean.csv"

# make dataframe from a file
df <- read_csv(my_file)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Histogram of confirmed and death cases"}
df %>%
  select(confirmed,death) %>%
  keep(is.numeric) %>%
  gather() %>%
  ggplot(aes(value)) +
  facet_wrap(~key, scales = "free") +
  geom_histogram()+
  theme_wsj() +
  scale_fill_wsj()
```


``` {r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}

#' Check and report your distributions for y and x variables: 
#' use histograms and summary statistics table 
#' (mean, median, min, max, standard deviation)

summary_stats_death <- df %>% summarise(
  mean = mean(death),
  median = median(death),
  std = sd(death),
  min = min(death),
  max = max(death))

summary_stats_confirmed <- df %>% summarise(
  mean = mean(confirmed),
  median = median(confirmed),
  std = sd(confirmed),
  min = min(confirmed),
  max = max(confirmed))
```

Tables below shows that on average there are 5472 death cases and 209452 registered cases. Mean is higher than median both for death numbers and registered cases indicating a skewed distribution with a long right tail.  

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
d_table <- kable(summary_stats_death, caption = "Summary statistics on number of death")

c_table <- kable(summary_stats_confirmed, caption = "Summary statistics on number of registered cases")

```

## Variable transformation

**level - level** 

Substantive: distribution does not give meaningful interpretation

Statistical: there are some influential observations that governing the conditional mean. Graph is given in Appendix

**level y - log x:**

Substantive reasoning: level changes in death cases is harder to interpret

Statistical reasoning: log transformation shows the better approximation and capturing the non-linearity in data. Graph is given in Appendix

**log y - level x:**

Most of the observations are very close to each other at the bottom of the distribution of number of registered cases.

Substantive reasoning: level changes in registered cases is harder to interpret
Statistical reasoning: log transformation of number of registered death and taking level of number of case does not give meaningful non-linear approximation. Graph is given in Appendix


**log y - log x**

Taking log of number of registered death and log of number of registered case is making the association close to linear

Substantive reasoning: it is easier to interpret the percentage change in number of death per percentage change in confirmed case

Statistical reasoning: it shows the better approximation: making the association close to linear


```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=3, fig.cap="log y - log x transformation" }

ggplot( df , aes(x = confirmed, y = death ))  +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="loess")+
  labs(x = "Number of registered case (31 October 2020, ln scale)",y = "Number of registered death (ln scale)") +
  scale_x_continuous( trans = log_trans() )+
  scale_y_continuous( trans = log_trans() )
```

## Estimating different models

Four different models were created. 

**First model** illustrates Simple Linear Regression for log of number of death regressed on log of number of registered cases:

Regression model 1: ln_death = alpha + beta * ln_confirmed

R squared: 0.8944

In this model, intercept is -4.406 and slope is 1.03. 

**Second model** shows Quadratic (linear) regression for log of number of death regressed on log of number of registered cases:

Regression model 2: ln_death = alpha + beta_1 * ln_confirmed + beta_2 * ln_confirmed^2

R squared: 0.90

In this model, intercept is -1.03 and slope 1 (beta1) is 0.31 and slope 2 (beta2) is 0.04.

**Third model** is for Piecewise linear spline regression. 3 cutoff points (knots) were chosen: 8,12,14

Regression model 3: ln_death = alpha + beta_1 * ln_confirmed * 1(ln_confirmed < 8) + beta_2 * ln_confirmed * 1(8 <= ln_confirmed  <= 12)

R-squared: 0.9037


**Fourth model** demonstrates Weighted linear regression, using population as weights.

R-squared: 0.9281

This model was chosen as it has higher R squared compared to other models


## Hypothesis testing

The following test was carried out: 
H0 : beta = 0; HA : beta != 0

The significance level that was chosen is 5%. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Add log of confirmed cases and log of number of death
df <- df %>% 
      mutate(ln_confirmed = log(confirmed),
             ln_death = log(death))
# for 5% change in x, we observe 5% change in y value

# exclude countries with negative logs
df <- df %>% filter( ln_death >= 0)

reg4 <- lm_robust(ln_death ~ ln_confirmed, data = df , weights = population)

hypo_table <- linearHypothesis(reg4, "ln_confirmed = 0")
kable(hypo_table, caption = "Hypothesis table")


```

Table above shows that p-value is smaller than 2.2e-16 which is very close to zero. Since it is very small, we reject the null.
Rejecting the H0 : beta = 0 means that slope is not equal to 0. Therefore, there is a correlation between log of number of confirmed cases and log of number of death cases


## Analysis of the residuals 
The table shows that the countries with the largest negative errors - countries who saved (relatively) the most people due to covid are: Singapore, Burundi, Sri Lanka, Qatar and Iceland. The  countries with the largest positive errors - countries who lost (relatively) the most people due to covid are: Mexico, Ecuador, Italy, Bolivia and Sudan. 


```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Get the predicted y values from the model
df$reg4_y_pred <- reg4$fitted.values
# Calculate the errors of the model
df$reg4_res <- df$ln_death - df$reg4_y_pred 

# Find countries with largest positive errors
# lost most: actual values are above regression line >> more people died than expected

# Find countries who lost (relatively) the most people due to covid using the model result: worst 5 residual.
top_5 <- df %>% top_n( 5 , reg4_res ) %>% 
  select( country , ln_death , reg4_y_pred , reg4_res ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(reg4_res))

# Find countries with largest negative errors
top_negative_5 <- df %>% top_n( -5 , reg4_res ) %>% 
  select( country , ln_death, reg4_y_pred , reg4_res ) %>% 
  arrange(reg4_res)

kable(top_5, caption = "Countries with largest positive errors")
kable(top_negative_5, caption = "Countries with largest negative errors")

```

## Executive summary

As a result of analysis of variable of number of death (y) and number of registered case (x), it was clear that there is a clear linear association between them. 

The main message of the chosen model (Weighted linear regression model) is that there is positive correlation between two variables. More observations would reduce the error, make the model to better fit the data and strengthen the results.

  geom_smooth(method="loess")+
  labs(x = "Number of registered case (31 October 2020)",y = "Number of registered death") 

```

# 1st define the cutoff for gdp per capita
cutoff <- c(8,12,14) # or use c(10, 50)
# 2nd we use a log transformation -> cutoff needs to be transformed as well
# Use simple regression with the lspline function
reg3 <- lm_robust(ln_death ~ lspline( ln_confirmed , cutoff), data = df )
summary( reg3 )

```


**Weighted linear regression**

Substantive reasoning: it is easier to interpret the percentage change in number of death to the percentage change in confirmed case

Statistical reasoning: this model captures the observations better, covering residuals also 

```{r, echo = FALSE,  warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=3, fig.cap="Fourth model: Weighted linear regression, using population as weights"}
reg4 <- lm_robust(ln_death ~ ln_confirmed, data = df , weights = population)
summary( reg4 )

ggplot(data = df, aes(x = ln_confirmed, y = ln_death)) +
  geom_point(data = df, aes(size=population),  color = 'blue', shape = 16, alpha = 0.6,  show.legend=F) +
  geom_smooth(aes(weight = population), method = "lm", color='red')+
  scale_size(range = c(1, 15)) +
  labs(x = "Number of confirmed cases (ln scale) ",y = "Number of death cases, (ln scale)")
```
