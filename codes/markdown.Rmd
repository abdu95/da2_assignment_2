# Introduction

This is the Assignment 2 for `Data Analysis 2`  and `Coding` course. The aim of this project is  to predict house price based on its area and other variables. House price prediction can help the sellers of a house to determine the selling price of a house and can help the customer to arrange the right time to purchase a house.

# Data collection

 Data set was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/prevek18/ames-housing-dataset). It contains information from the Ames Assessor’s Office used in computing assessed values for individual residential properties sold in Ames, Iowa (IA) from 2006 to 2010.
 This data was collected by Ames Assessor’s Office, one of the cities of Iowa. This data is representative only for this state. Since this is administrative data that was collected by government office, we assume that there was no (or few) mistakes in entering data. Also, we have almost all necessary variables that matters for the house sale price (such as area, quality, rooms, etc).
 
### Data descriptives
 Variables capture the house price and other conditions such as area of a house and garage, number of rooms, availability of fireplace, pool and others. I want to use these variables to predict house price given the certain house condition (area, rooms, fireplaces).
 The data has 2930 observations. It consists of 82 columns which include 23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous variables (and 2 additional observation identifiers, Order and Parcel ID). These variables describe the sales price of a house and its condition, such as area, quality, rooms, etc.
 As an outcome variable, we have chosen **SalePrice** (in US dollars) variable. The main parameter of interest (explanatory variable) is **Above Ground Area** (in square feet) of a house. Full summary statistics and distributions of explanatory variables are given in Appendix.

df$Bsmt.Qual.fact <- factor(df$Bsmt.Qual, order = TRUE,
                            levels = c("No Basement", "Po", "Fa", "TA", "Gd","Ex"))

df$Bsmt.Qual.unfact <- unfactor(df$Bsmt.Qual.fact)

df$Bsmt.Qual.num <- as.numeric(factor(df$Bsmt.Qual.fact,
                  levels = c("No Basement","Po", "Fa", "TA", "Gd", "Ex")))

df$MS.Zoning.num <- as.numeric(factor(df$MS.Zoning.fact))
# RM 7 RL 6 RH 5 I 4  FV 3 C 2 A 1

df$Overall.Qual.num <- unfactor(as.factor(df$Overall.Qual.fact))

df$BsmtFin.Type.1.num <- 
  as.numeric(factor(df$BsmtFin.Type.1.fact,
                    levels = c("No Basement", "Unf", "LwQ", "Rec", "BLQ", "ALQ", "GLQ")))
# GLQ 7 ALQ 6 BLQ 5 Rec 4 LwQ 3 Unf 2 No Basement 1

```
The histogram below shows the house sale prices. We can see that on average, most of the houses are priced from 100,000 to 200,000 dollars. It's skewed to the right, meaning that only few houses were priced extremely high. 


```{r, echo = FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Histogram of house sale prices"}

# Check the main parameter of interests and potential confounders:

# SalePrice
ggplot(df, aes(x = SalePrice)) +
  geom_histogram(fill='navyblue') +
  labs(x = "Sale price of houses")

```

## Data Cleaning 

### Outliers

When outcome variable SALE PRICE and parameter of interest GR LIV AREA (above ground living area square feet) were plotted, there were 5 observations with extreme values. When inspected, it was clear that two of these outliers have more than 5000 square feet area (which is extremely high) but nevertheless priced relatively appropriately. Also, three of them had Partial Sales that likely don’t represent actual
market values. Therefore, I removed all houses with more than 4000 square feet from the data set to avoid these five unusual observations (Appendix, Figure 4. 

Therefore, re-iterated research question is the following: 
**Does a house with higher above ground living area (considering it's less than 4000 square feet) have higher price from 2006 - 2010 in Ames (Iowa) ?**


### Data Type for variables
An appropriate format was given to categorical (numeric and ordinal) variables (see Appendix). 

### Missing values
Missing values in qualitative variables
As it was described in original data description, in some categorical variables, NA didn't mean missing value. Therefore, corresponding name was assigned to the observations with such values (such as "No garage" or "No garage"). 

I decided to drop columns “Alley”, “Misc.Feature”, “Fence”, “Pool.Qu” and “Fireplace.Qu” because more than 90% (48% of Fireplace.Qu) of their values were missing. 
Observations with NAs in all the garage related columns, were completed with the value “No garage” in case of nominal attribute.
I have not to used Street variable (Type of road access to property) as there are only 12 houses with Gravel and 2913 of them are Paved

# Pattern of association

With the help of scatter-plots and LOESS method, we want to check the pattern of association between *y* and each potential *x* variables. 

First, we see the plot of Sale Price and Above Ground Area since it's our main parameter of interest. The plot below shows that there is a strong linear relationship between these two variables. 


```{r, echo = FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Plot of Above Ground Area of houses"}

# Create a general function to check the pattern
chck_sp <- function(x_var, x_lab){
  ggplot( df , aes(x = x_var, y = SalePrice)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method="loess" , formula = y ~ x )+
    labs(y = "Sale price of houses", x = x_lab) 
}

chck_sp(df$Gr.Liv.Area, " Above ground living area square feet")  

```
 
The scatterplots that shows the pattern of association between *y variable* (Sale Price) and other explanatory variables are given in Appendix.

After we saw which kind of relationship the variables have, now we have an idea on how build a regression model and what variables to include into our model. 
 

# Comparing explanatory variables

We selected x variables that has shown strong association with y variables. Total Area, Above Ground Area, Garage Area are among them. Now we explore how these x-s are related to each other. 


```{r,echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

selected_var_df <- data.frame("SalePrice" = df$SalePrice, "TotalArea" = df$TotalArea, 
                              "Lot.Area" = df$Lot.Area, "HasFireplace" = df$HasFireplace, 
                              "Garage.Area" = df$Garage.Area, "Total.Bsmt.SF" =  df$Total.Bsmt.SF, 
                              "Gr.Liv.Area" = df$Gr.Liv.Area, "Bsmt.Qual" = df$Bsmt.Qual.num, 
                              "MS.Zoning" = df$MS.Zoning.num, "Overall.Qual" = df$Overall.Qual.num, 
                              "BsmtFin.Type.1" = df$BsmtFin.Type.1.num, "Year.Built" = df$Year.Built, 
                              "Year.Remod.Add" = df$Year.Remod.Add, "Garage.Yr.Blt" = df$Garage.Yr.Blt, 
                              "Garage.Cars" = df$Garage.Cars, "TotRms.AbvGrd" = df$TotRms.AbvGrd) 


# see correlation 
corTable <- round(cor(selected_var_df, use = "complete.obs"), digits = 2)
```


Table 1 shows the selected x variables and shows correlation between them.


```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
kable(corTable, caption = "Correlation table") %>%
  kable_styling("striped", full_width = F, latex_options="scale_down") %>%
  row_spec(0, angle = 90)
```



```{r,echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Check for highly correlated values:

# Find the correlations which are higher than 0.8
id_cr <- which( abs(corTable) >= 0.8 & corTable != 1 )
pair_names <- expand.grid( variable.names(selected_var_df) , variable.names(selected_var_df) )

# Get the pairs:
high_corr <- pair_names[ id_cr , ]
high_corr <- mutate( high_corr , corr_val = corTable[ id_cr ] )

# highly correlated - confounder (leads to multicollinearity )
# This high_corr should be in Appendix as Table
```


From the correlation table, we retained the variables that has correlation less than 0.8 and removed others. The reason for this is that  highly correlated variables may be confounders that leads us to multicollinearity issue (high Standard Error). Table 2 shows highly correlated variables.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
kable(high_corr, caption = "Variables with high correlation") 
```

The following variables showed correlation less than 0.8, therefore I decided to retain them for further analysis and include in regression model: 

*SalePrice*: Lot.Area, HasFireplace, Garage.Area, Total.Bsmt.SF, Gr.Liv.Area, Bsmt.Qual, MS.Zoning, BsmtFin.Type.1, Year.Built, Year.Remod.Add, Garage.Yr.Blt, Garage.Cars,  TotRms.AbvGrd

I also decided to include HasFireplace variable (as a dummy variable, 1 if house has one or more fireplaces, 0 otherwise). I want to interact HasFireplace variable with Gr.Liv.Area variable (Above ground area). The reason for controlling for such interaction is that building a fireplace in the house requires additional expenditure from the owners. Therefore, owners may tend to increase house price because of the fireplace.


# Model choice

I decided to build several regression models in order to see how they perform and pick up the best one later. 


First regression model is:

**SalePrice** = Beta0 + Beta1 * **Above Ground Area**

R^2 = 51

Second model is:

**SalePrice** =  Beta0 + Beta1 * **Basement Area** + Beta2 * **Above Ground Area**

R^2 = 0.68


```

reg23 <- lm_robust(SalePrice ~ Total.Bsmt.SF + Gr.Liv.Area, data = df)
summary(reg23)
# R2 = 0.68
```

# Intercept (Beta0): -36647. Does not have meaningful interpretation
# Total.Bsmt.SF (Beta1): 82.30. On average, SalePrice is 82.30 dollars higher in the data for houses with one square feet larger Total Basement Area but with the same Above Ground Living Area.
# Gr.Liv.Area (Beta2): 87.63. On average, SalePrice is 87.63 dollars higher in the data for houses with one square feet larger Above Ground Living Area but with the same Total Basement Area.


Earlier, we have seen strong linear relationship between these variables. Even though the model fits the data pretty well, it has low R^2.


# Residual Analysis

For these 5 countries in table 2(see Appendix), the model overestimated life expectancy, as the actual value is smaller than the predicted value; in another word, these countries have short life span than average. The explanation could be extreme weather(temperature too hot or too cold) or worsened social safety conditions.

For these 5 countries in table 3(see Appendix), the model underestimated life expectancy, as the actual value is larger than the predicted value; in another word, these countries have longer life span than average. The explanation could be healthy(Mediterranean and Eastern Asian diet) or complete social security administration.

Also, we check the y and y_hat plot(see Appendix) to examine the model fit. We can see that most scatters fall aside the line, indicating a good fit of the model.

### Data descriptives

```{r,echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

get_statistics <- function(x_var){ summarise(df,

# Fireplaces
ggplot(df, aes(x = Fireplaces)) +

## Data Cleaning 
clean_data.R script contains all the steps for data cleaning. Exact number of missing values in certain variables are also given as a comment

```{r, echo = FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Plot of houses more than 4000 square feet Above Ground Area"}
df_r <- read.csv('../data/raw/Housing_raw.csv')
# Outliers
ggplot(df_r, aes(Gr.Liv.Area, SalePrice)) +
  geom_point()


```

### Data Type for variables
An appropriate format was given to categorical (numeric and ordinal) variables. In order to make it easier for further use, categorical variables were converted from character (or numeric) vector into nominal and ordinal variables (using factor and ordered factor) in clean_data.R script


## Pattern of association

Plot shows bunch of dots near 0. Probably the Sale Price and Lot Area variables are not correlated.


```{r, echo = FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Plot of Sale Price and Lot Area"}
chck_sp(df$Lot.Area, "Lot Area")
```

Ln(Sale Price) - Ln(Lot Area).  Probably linear spline, with knots at 8 and 10

```{r, echo = FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Plot of Ln(Sale Price) - Ln(Lot Area)."}

ggplot( df , aes(x = log(Lot.Area), y = log(SalePrice))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="loess" , formula = y ~ x )+
  labs(y = "Sale price of houses", x = "Lot Area") 
```

The more regular shape house has, the higher the price. But some Irregular houses has same price as Regular houses. 

Reg	Regular	

IR1	Slightly irregular

IR2	Moderately Irregular

IR3	Irregular

```{r, echo = FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Plot of Sale Price - Lot Shape"}
chck_sp(df$Lot.Shape.fact, "General shape of property")
```


Houses with 1 or more fireplaces have higher price

```{r, echo = FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Plot of Sale Price - Fireplace"}
chck_sp(df$HasFireplace, "Has Fireplace")
```


Almost positive linear, but some outliers at the end causing the line to curve. Seems Garage Area variable is important

```{r, echo = FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Plot of Sale Price - Garage Area"}
chck_sp(df$Garage.Area, "Garage Area")
```

There is a linear relationship between Sale Price and Total square feet of basement area

```{r, echo = FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Plot of Sale Price - Basement area"}
chck_sp(df$Total.Bsmt.SF, "Total square feet of basement area")
```

On average, houses with more garage cars have higher price
```{r, echo = FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Plot of Sale Price - Garage.Cars"}
chck_sp(df$Garage.Cars, "Size of garage in car capacity")
```


Near Flat/Level	and Hillside houses have higher prices.


```{r, echo = FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Plot of Sale Price - Land.Contour"}
chck_sp(df$Land.Contour.fact, "Land Contour")
```


There are 2922 houses with All Public *Utilities*. Since we don't have much observations with different utilities, it was decided not to check the pattern of association and not to include this variable in the model. 



Cul-de-sac and Inside lot has higher prices

```{r, echo = FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Plot of Sale Price - Land Configuration"}
chck_sp(df$Lot.Config.fact, " Lot configuration")
```


Houses with *Gentle slope* and *Moderate Slope* have higher prices


```{r, echo = FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Plot of Sale Price - Land Slope"}
chck_sp(df$Land.Slope.fact, "Slope")
```


Houses from Northridge, Northridge Heights, and Stone Brook neighborhoods have relatively high prices


```{r, echo = FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Plot of Sale Price - Neighborhood"}
ggplot( df , aes(x = Neighborhood.fact, y = SalePrice)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="loess" , formula = y ~ x )+
  labs(y = "Sale price of houses", x = "Neighborhood") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))  
```


Houses with Normal and "Adjacent to postive off-site feature" conditions have relatively high prices

```{r, echo = FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Plot of Sale Price - House Condition"}
chck_sp(df$Condition.1.fact, "Condition 1")
```


Most of the houses are Single-family Detached. Single-family Detached and Townhouse End Unit houses have relatively high prices


```{r, echo = FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Plot of Sale Price - Type of building"}
chck_sp(df$Bldg.Type.fact, "Type of building")
```


Most of the houses are One story and Two story. One story and Two story houses have relatively high prices


```{r, echo = FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Plot of Sale Price - Style of house"}
chck_sp(df$House.Style.fact, "Style of house")
```


Higher rating - higher sale price. But some houses has quality 6 but has same price as quality 2

```{r, echo = FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Plot of Sale Price -  House rating"}
chck_sp(df$Overall.Qual.fact, "Rating of overall material and finish of the house")
```


Most of the houses have Average (5) condition. Average conditioned houses have relatively high prices

```{r, echo = FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Plot of Sale Price -  House condition "}
chck_sp(df$Overall.Cond.fact, "Rating of the overall condition of the house")
```


The newer the house (the later is the year built) -  the higher the price. But some houses that are built before 1900 were priced realtively high. There is an upward trend


```{r, echo = FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Plot of Sale Price -  Year Built "}
chck_sp(df$Year.Built, "Year Built")
```



I also checked the pattern of association between Sale Price and Total Area of a house. TotalArea = Total Basement Area + Above Ground Area

*Total Bsmt SF* - Total square feet of basement area. (basement - below the ground floor)

*Gr Liv Area* - Above ground living area square feet


The total square footage model indicates some possible curvature (convex) which could be better interpreted with quadratic variables.


```{r, echo = FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Plot of Sale Price -  Total Area"}
chck_sp(df$TotalArea, "Total Area of a house")
```


Total basement area and Above ground area with Sale Condition

```{r, echo = FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.cap = "Plot of Sale Price -  Total Area with Sale Condition"}
ggplot(df, aes(Total.Bsmt.SF + Gr.Liv.Area, SalePrice)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Sale.Condition.fact, shape = Sale.Condition.fact)) + 
  labs(x = "Total basement area + Above ground area")
```


## Model choice

Regression 1.1:

SalePrice = Beta0 + Beta1 * Lot Area + Beta2 * HasFireplace

R2 = 0.27


Regression 1.2:
SalePrice = Beta0 + Beta1 * Total Area

R2 = 68

Even though this model fits the data very well, we dont take this model as TotalArea is higly correlated to SalePrice - multicollinearity issue. 


Regression 1.3:
SalePrice = Beta0 +  Beta1 * Garage Area

R2 = 42

Regression 1.4:
SalePrice = Beta0 +  Beta1 * Total square feet of basement area

R2 = 43

Regression 1.5 
SalePrice = Beta0 +  Beta1 * Basement quality

R2 = 37


Regression 1.6 
SalePrice = Beta0 +  Beta1 * MS.Zoning

R2 = 0.01

Regression 1.7 
SalePrice = Beta0 +  Beta1 * BsmtFin.Type.1

R2 = 0.11

Regression 1.8 
SalePrice = Beta0 + Beta1 * Year.Built

R2 = 0.31

Regression 1.9 
SalePrice = Beta0 + Beta1 * Year.Remod.Add

R2 = 0.29

Regression 2.0 
SalePrice = Beta0 + Beta1 * Garage.Yr.Blt

R2 = 0.28

Regresssion 2.1 
SalePrice = Beta0 + Beta1 * Garage.Cars

R2 = 0.42

Regression 2.2 
SalePrice = Beta0 + Beta1 * TotRms.AbvGrd

R2 = 0.24
